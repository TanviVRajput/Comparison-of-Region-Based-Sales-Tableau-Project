**Project Goal:**

The objective of this project is to assist a leading organization in visualizing sales data between two selected regions using a dashboard. By comparing sales performance, the organization can identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions to enhance productivity and profitability.

**Steps to Perform:**

**Data Preparation:**

- Select the Sample Superstore dataset as the primary data source.
  
- Use grouping to organize data for Customer Name and Order ID, facilitating thorough data organization.
  
**Hierarchy Creation:**

- Create a hierarchy named "Location" for the variable "Country" to categorize sales data by regions effectively.
  
**Parameter Setup:**

- Create two parameters: "Primary Region" and "Secondary Region" listing all regions for comparison purposes.
  
- These parameters will allow users to select the regions they want to compare.
  
**Calculated Fields Creation:**

- Create calculated fields for both the Primary and Secondary regions to filter the data accordingly.
  
- Develop a calculated field named "First Order Date" to track the initial sales date.
  
**Dashboard Creation:**

- Construct a dashboard to visualize sales comparison metrics between the Primary and Secondary regions.
  
- Align all sheets within the dashboard for clarity and ease of understanding.
  
**Dashboard Partitioning:**

- Partition the dashboard to display the following details for both the Primary and Secondary regions:
  
- **First Order Date**
